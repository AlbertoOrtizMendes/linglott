        <p class='seedbad'>About us</p>
        <p>Linglott was born after two friends from different parts of the world realised the amount of struggle that goes to learning a new language and adapting to a different culture.
        </p>
        <p>A struggle that doesn’t involve grammar rules or vocabulary memorisation, but one that involves having a hard time figuring out the best way to learn and where the best and most importantly, accessible teachers are. After spending a couple
          years
          trying different solutions, they realised that enough is enough and then Linglott was created to fill this gap.</p>
